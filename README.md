## What is Sprinkles

Sprinkles is a reusable UI library created in React. These components are common to most sites and web apps. They are very extendable and theme-able.

## Why Sprinkles?

At Signal, we have a large number of web apps, both internal and external each having their own UI. We wanted to create a library of reusable components that each UI could implement and benefit from a unified look, feel, and function. Our components can be scattered throughout a site or web application and themed to match your particular design. It's easy to use and very customizable.

## What is this project about?

We wanted to create a foundational UI that would allow anyone to get a web app or site started quickly without needing to recreate commonly used elements like forms and validation. We invite you to read more about [our mission](./MISSION.md) and governance model. By using or contributing to our project, you agree to our [code of conduct](./CODEOFCONDUCT.md) and [license](./LICENSE.md).

## Style Guide

**CSS**

Within CSS rules, please make sure all the selectors are in alphabetical order. There's one exception, for 'height' and 'width', place these at the end and put 'height' before 'width'.

## Atom config

We suggest using Atom for its useful code style integrations that make working with our linters easy. Here are a list of suggested packages.

* [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)
* [es6-javascript](https://atom.io/packages/es6-javascript)
* [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
* [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)
